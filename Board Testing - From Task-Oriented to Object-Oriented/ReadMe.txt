This project was originally a copy of the Board Testing project found at C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2018\examples\Object-Oriented Programming\Board Testing

We only kept the Task-Oriented part to show a path to converting a task-oriented program to an object-oriented program in LabVIEW.
